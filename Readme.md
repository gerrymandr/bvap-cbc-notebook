# BVAP and Membership in the Congressional Black Caucus

In this notebook, we explore the relationship between the Black Voting Age Population (BVAP) of a congressional district and whether or not that district is represented by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Data on Citizen Voting Age Population is drawn from [the 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5 year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html). The relevant file, `CD.csv`, is included in this repository for convenience.

Data on Congressional Black Caucus membership (`cbc.csv`) was parsed from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus#Membership) for the Congressional Black Caucus (accessed 10/9/2018). We added Rep. John Conyers (who represented Michigan's 13th Congressional District until 2017) to the dataset to reflect the Caucus's membership after the 2016 election.
